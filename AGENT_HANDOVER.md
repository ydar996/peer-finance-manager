## 0. IMMUTABLE AGENT INSTRUCTIONS (always follow)

> **Self-instructing rule for every agent, now and forever:**  
> **Read this section first. Document every change immediately in the same turn. The user must never have to ask you to update documentation.**

**Every change we make — and every outstanding task we discover, start, complete, or reprioritize — MUST be documented immediately and continuously for the next agent. Not at the end of a session. Not "when the user asks." Not only on commit.**

Documentation is the handoff contract between sessions. If it is stale, the next agent will guess or re-read chat transcripts and waste the user's time.

**Cursor enforces this via:** `.cursor/rules/continuous-documentation.mdc` (`alwaysApply: true`) — agents must follow it on every task without being reminded.

### Continuous documentation rule (non-negotiable)

1. **Read this file first** at the start of every session — before relying on chat history or agent transcripts.
2. **Document as you go** — in the same session, **in the same turn** when the change lands (before your reply to the user):
   - **§ Changelog** — append a dated bullet the moment you implement a feature, fix, or behavior change.
   - **§ Outstanding tasks** — add, update, mark ✅, or remove tasks the moment their status changes.
   - **Other docs** — update per the checklist below whenever those areas are affected.
3. **Never wait for the user** to say "update the docs," "sync documentation," or "update the handover." That request should never be needed.
4. **Before ending any session** that touched code or config: verify changelog and outstanding tasks match the final state (including uncommitted local changes).
5. **If the user commits without you:** on the next session, reconcile `git log` against this file and backfill any gaps immediately.

**Failure to keep docs current is a session failure — treat it like leaving broken code.**

### Per-change checklist (do this every time)

| Step | Action | When |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Read `AGENT_HANDOVER.md` §0 + changelog + tasks | Start of every session |
| 2 | Implement code/config change | During work |
| 3 | Update `AGENT_HANDOVER.md` changelog + tasks | **Same turn** as step 2 |
| 4 | Update other docs from table below | **Same turn** if affected |
| 5 | Verify docs match final repo state | Before session ends |

### Required documentation updates (checklist)

| When you change… | Update these files (immediately) |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Any feature, bug fix, or behavior | **AGENT_HANDOVER.md** — § Changelog + § Outstanding tasks |
| User-visible screens, login, or workflows | **USER-GUIDE.md** |
| Deploy, cloud, Git push, or data upload | **UPDATE-AND-PUBLISH.md** and/or **DEPLOY-TODAY.md** |
| Architecture, ports, stack, folder layout | **README.md** — Architecture + Project layout |
| UI labels/buttons (Title Case rules) | `.cursor/rules/ui-copy-standards.mdc` and **UI-COPY-STANDARDS.md** if conventions change |
| Data upload to production (WinSCP) | **UPLOAD-DATA-TO-PRODUCTION.md** |
| Port numbers | **Ports in Use by Applications.md** (project copy + Desktop master) |

### Changelog rule

Append a dated bullet under **§ Changelog** in this file **as soon as the change is made**:

```
- **YYYY-MM-DD** — What changed, why, and any production/deploy notes.
```

### Outstanding tasks rule

- **Add** new tasks the moment they are discovered — do not wait.
- **Mark completed** items ✅ or remove them the moment they are done.
- **Reprioritize** when scope or urgency changes.
- Keep **High / Medium / Low** sections current; fix duplicate numbering when editing.

### Production safety rules

1. **Never commit** `data/`, `*.db`, credentials CSV, or `.env` — they are gitignored.
2. **Never set** `PFM_COOP_ROOT` on Render — breaks module loading (use `PFM_DATA_DIR` only).
3. **Code deploy** = `git push` → Netlify + Render auto-deploy. **Data deploy** = WinSCP to `/var/data` + Render Manual Deploy (separate step).
4. **Do not git commit** unless the user explicitly asks.
5. After cloud-affecting changes, note whether user must **re-upload data** or only **git push**.
6. **No em dashes** in user-facing app copy — use colons (`:`). See `.cursor/rules/ui-copy-standards.mdc`.

## Changelog

- **2026-07-05** — **Apply embed scroll fix:** FlexxForms embed URLs now include `?embed=1` (required for `flexxforms:resize` postMessage). `flexxforms-embed.js` keeps iframe scrollable until resize arrives; fallback height if resize missing. Apply page card `overflow: visible`. **Country dropdown "Loading…":** FlexxForms-side. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-07-05** — **Apply embed mobile height:** `flexxforms-embed.js` listens for FlexxForms `flexxforms:resize` postMessage and grows the iframe to fit the form (no nested scroll). Apply page hero compact on mobile. **Country dropdown "Loading…":** FlexxForms-side (lazy country library in embed); needs FlexxForms default US on address field or chunk-load fix. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-07-05** — **About hero section jumps:** Membership, Goals, and Leadership chips on `/c/{slug}/about` are now anchor buttons that scroll to `#membership`, `#goals`, and `#officials`; static chips removed on Bylaws/Apply. **Member login:** removed duplicate standalone Apply link (kept single link in public org links row). **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-07-05** — **Public Apply for Membership pages:** `/c/{slug}/apply` served alongside About/Bylaws; nav, hero CTAs, footer links, and in-page **Become a Member** promos on About/Bylaws; FlexxForms iframe on apply page. Login/member footers link to apply when form is published; `/?apply={slug}` redirects to `/c/{slug}/apply`. Netlify redirect added in `scripts/netlify-build-config.js`. Files: `cooperative-public.html`, `cooperative-public.css`, `server.js`, `cooperative-public-pages-service.js`, `flexxforms-service.js`, `app.js`, `index.html`. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-07-05** — **FlexxForms membership pipeline:** public apply link (`/?apply={slug}`), webhook `form.submitted` auto-creates pending member profile (`cooperative_account_status: pending_approval`), admin **Membership Applications** panel with fee/deposit checklist, **Approve Member** gated on membership fee ($100) + initial contribution ($100 deposit). Files: `lib/flexxforms-membership-service.js`, webhook handler, routes, admin UI. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-07-04** — FlexxForms **document templates API:** `GET /integrations/documents/templates` merged into admin catalog load; forms vs master document assign targets; loan signing uses `signingUrl` / `signingSessions` (not `/embed/{id}` fallback). Webhook handles `document.updated` when status completed. FlexxForms fixed Assurance webhook URL to Render. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-07-04** — FlexxForms admin **Published in FlexxForms** catalog: card layout with UUID, four Assign targets (membership, loan, guarantor, borrower), linked state; removed browser `prompt()`. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-07-04** — FlexxForms **Load Forms** error copy: clarifies workspace must be connected (Retry → Ready badge) before listing forms; button disabled until provisioned. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-07-04** — **FlexxForms Assurance admin email (again):** logged-in session (`yinka@…`) was overriding canonical Assurance FlexxForms email in UI and retry. Assurance slug now always resolves to `assuranceflex@eworkchop.com`; startup backfill also syncs `flexxforms_admin_email`. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-07-04** — **FlexxForms Assurance admin email fix:** startup backfill had set `admin_email` to first org admin (`yinka@eworkchop.com`) before Assurance override could run; Load Forms failed with no API key. Assurance now always gets `assuranceflex@eworkchop.com`; retry uses logged-in admin email first. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-07-04** — **FlexxForms retry-provision fix (cooperative admin):** legacy orgs had NULL `organizations.admin_email`, so Retry FlexxForms Setup failed before calling FlexxForms ensure. Added `admin_email` on registry `organizations`, `resolveFlexxFormsAdminEmail()` (org row then logged-in admin session), startup backfill from first org admin user (+ Assurance `assuranceflex@eworkchop.com`), register-organization persists admin email before provision, `applyEnsureResponse` fills form/doc ids from `readyToUse` only when empty (preserves saved membership form id). Files: `lib/flexxforms-service.js`, `lib/flexxforms-routes.js`, `lib/organization-service.js`, `lib/auth-service.js`, `lib/auth-routes.js`. **Production:** `git push` only.
- **2026-07-03** — **FlexxForms Plan B:** each Cooperative gets its own FlexxForms workspace on register (`POST /platform/workspaces/ensure`). Credentials on registry `organizations` (secrets server-only). Admin **Manage Forms & Documents** (open FlexxForms, save form/doc ids, retry provision, list forms). Member loan apply embed; public membership apply from member login. Loan guarantor/borrower agreements via integrations API + in-app iframe. Webhook `POST /api/flexxforms/webhook` (raw body + HMAC). Env: `FLEXXFORMS_API_BASE`, `FLEXXFORMS_PROVISIONING_SECRET` on **Render** (API). Files: `lib/flexxforms-service.js`, `lib/flexxforms-routes.js`. **Production:** `git push` + set Render env vars if not already.
- **2026-07-03** — Product page Work Chop footer: compact content-sized badge (`width: fit-content`, smaller logo/padding) instead of full-width banner; mobile stacks logo above text. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-07-03** — Headings and section leads use full content width **app-wide** (`product.css`, `styles.css`, `cooperative-public.css`, legacy `public/styles.css`): no artificial `max-width` on titles/hints/leads. Form/input layout widths unchanged. Hero: five dashboard mock cards; mobile/tablet grid shows all cards. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-07-03** — **Cooperative capitalization enforced app-wide for all tenants:** `capitalizeCooperativeWording()` in `text-format.js`; public About/Bylaws sanitize + save; API error JSON middleware; HTML builder `esc()`; seed v12. **Production:** `git push`; Render restart re-seeds public pages.
- **2026-07-03** — Product page polish: workflow step 4 real-time copy; centered Work Chop footer (mobile stack); trust section color cards + title case; **Title Case rule** extended (lowercase 2–3 letter words; capitalize **Cooperative**); footer tagline update. Bylaws nested Roman lists under letter items (seed v10). **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-07-02** — Product page (`/product`), `PEER-FINANCE-MANAGER.md`, bylaws HTML rebuild (structured lists/sections from PDF source), public content seed v9. **Em/en dash purge** in user-facing UI (`product.html`, `app.js`, `index.html`, emails, timezone labels, ledger CSV headers): colons per `UI-COPY-STANDARDS.md`. **Production:** `git push`. Admin → Cooperative Books → **Meetings & Announcements** — schedule drafts, announce to member portal + email, cancel, automatic reminders (per-org). Member portal **Cooperative Meetings** panel. Files: `cooperative-meeting-service.js`, `meeting-notification-service.js`. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-07-01** — Member portal UX: hide tab nav and redundant **My Account** heading (members land on account content directly); mobile header declutter; logout power icon. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-07-01** — **Proxy Zelle deposit fixes:** import credits beneficiary named after `for …` in description (not Zelle payer); pre-import **Ledger warnings** on Admin → Import (proxy mis-credit + contribution vs loan type); regression script `node peer-finance-manager/scripts/test-ledger-import-audit.js`. Corrected `cooperative-bank-ledger-reference.xlsx` (Ejiro/Titilope proxy rows; Oluwabiyi Mar 23 $100.13 → deposit). Utility scripts: `fix-proxy-deposit-members.js` (xlsx Member column), `fix-proxy-deposit-balances.js` (local DB one-shot). **Production:** `git push` then **Admin → Import** upload corrected xlsx (no WinSCP for bank ledger).
- **2026-06-29** — Bank import conflict handling with **Download missing rows CSV**; **Sort selected file & download** and **Download sorted reference CSV** (date-ordered `cooperative-bank-ledger-reference.csv` from upload or live books). Auto-sync reference CSV on manual entries. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-06-28** — Fix bank import upload error (`importBankLedger is not a function`) — circular require between `bank-import.js` and `import-bank-ledger.js`; lazy-load import inside `runBankImportFromUpload`. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-06-28** — **Admin bank ledger import on live site:** Admin → Import → **Bank Ledger Import** uploads cooperative workbook (.xlsx) and optional bank statement (.csv); updates production DB immediately (no WinSCP/Manual Deploy). API: `POST /api/bank-import/run`. Month-end auto-publish toggle on Cooperative Books. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-06-28** — Added **EMAIL-NOTIFICATIONS-SETUP.md** (layman steps to enable SMTP on Render for member report emails).
- **2026-06-28** — Olawale George WPForms row added to CSV and imported locally (`f5ec8e6`). **UPLOAD-DATA-TO-PRODUCTION.md** clarifies Manual Deploy is required after every WinSCP upload (stale DB connection). Fixed `pfm:profiles` script org context.
- **2026-06-27** — Member report email notifications: SMTP on Render sends reminders on the **last day of each month** and when a cooperative status report is **published** (profile email or member login email). Env: `SMTP_*`, `MEMBER_PORTAL_URL`. Deduped in `member_report_email_log`. **Production:** `git push` + Render env vars.
- **2026-06-27** — Monthly status report "as at" date: manual admin **Generate Report** uses **today's date** (not month-end); scheduled auto-generate at month end still uses the last calendar day. Dashboard preview matches. **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-06-26** — Production data upload reliability: after WinSCP replaces `peerfinance.db`, **Manual Deploy** is required so the running Node process reopens the file (stale in-memory SQLite connection showed old Cooperative Books totals while disk/Shell were correct). Code: auto-remove stale `.wal`/`.shm` on open; do not restore from `peerfinance.seed.db` when live DB is newer; `/api/health` includes ledger probe (`latestTransaction`, `bankImportRows`, `dbSize`). Docs: **UPLOAD-DATA-TO-PRODUCTION.md** Step 4 (sidecars + seed). **Production:** `git push`.
- **2026-06-26** — Title Case backfill script: `npm run pfm:normalize-profiles` (dry-run) / `pfm:normalize-profiles:apply`. After apply locally, WinSCP upload + Manual Deploy.
- **2026-06-18** — Monthly Cooperative Status Report: per-organization PDF (not Assurance-specific); admin toggles for auto-generate at month end and auto-publish to member portal; manual Generate / Publish / Download on Cooperative Books; members see published reports on My Account. Storage: `data/organizations/{slug}/reports/cooperative-status/`. Scheduler runs all orgs every 6 hours. **Production:** `git push` only.
- **2026-06-18** — Member biodata Title Case: `peer-finance-manager/lib/text-format.js` normalizes names on create/update/import; display path formats legacy DB rows. WPForms import keeps raw `applicationName` for ledger matching. **Deployed:** `2ce0dd7` (`git push`).
- **2026-06-21** — Typography hierarchy: section headers larger/bolder than description (`.subtle`) text app-wide.
- **2026-06-21** — Agreed Loan Repayment Schedule: removed empty Payment column; balance reduces by interest plus principal each period.
- **2026-06-21** — Loan repayment **Balance** now tracks **principal still owed** (matches Paid status); repayments list newest-first. Fixes paid loans showing non-zero balance when total payable included unearned scheduled interest.
- **2026-06-21** — Loan account UX: **Agreed Loan Repayment Schedule** collapsed by default (no Due column; Balance column); actual repayments show running **Balance**; active loans expanded, paid loans collapsed.
- **2026-06-21** — Strengthened continuous documentation: `.cursor/rules/continuous-documentation.mdc` (`alwaysApply`); §0 self-instructing rules — agents must update docs in the same turn as every change; user must never need to ask for doc updates.
- **2026-06-21** — Admin can upload member profile photos from **Members & Accounts** (`POST /api/members/:id/photo`); members retain self-service upload/update. **Production:** `git push` only.
- **2026-06-19** — Fixed member profile photo upload: restore org context after multer async parse (was "No organization selected"); mobile Upload Photo button styled as primary full-width.
- **2026-06-19** — Full documentation sync: all project docs updated to match codebase; §0 strengthened with continuous documentation rule.
- **2026-06-19** — Fixed Gbanju alias (`GBANJU P ARUWAYOOBE`); CD balance updated to $7,211.82 with term metrics and **Expected CD Interest** dashboard card; bank re-import now 0 skipped rows (57 loan repayments).
- **2026-06-19** — Bank import through 2026-06-16: merged 3 new BoA deposits (Lolu $50, Mutiu $100.04, Clement $100.02) into `data/bank-statement-2026.csv`; ran `import-bank-ledger.js` (450 bank_import txs, last date 2026-06-16). **Production:** WinSCP upload `data/` → Render `/var/data` + Manual Deploy required.
- **2026-06-19** — Added USER-GUIDE, UPDATE-AND-PUBLISH, UPLOAD-DATA-TO-PRODUCTION, immutable doc rules (§0). Production live on Netlify + Render.
- **2026-06-18** — Member profile portal UX (`c8521cc`): collapsible **Membership Biodata** and **Emergency Contact**; mobile-friendly layout; inline labels (`Middle Name:`, `Account Status: Active`). **Production:** `git push` only.
- **2026-06-18** — Member self-service (`5041977`): profile biodata view, emergency contact edit, optional photo upload (`member-self-service.js`); admin **Cooperative Books** CD metrics; UI copy standards (Title Case, no em dashes).
- **2026-06-18** — Bank ledger import wired: `peer-finance-manager/lib/import-bank-ledger.js` + `npm run pfm:import-bank` merges `All deposits.xlsx` + `data/bank-statement-2026.csv` into SQLite with **real bank dates** (deposits, withdrawals, loan repayments, expenses, CD transactions).
- **2026-06-18** — Date display fix: `formatDate()` / `formatDisplayDate()` parse `YYYY-MM-DD` as local calendar dates (fixes DOB and transaction dates showing one day early in US time zones). Files: `peer-finance-manager/public/app.js`, `lib/loan-statement-generator.js`. **Production:** `git push` only.
- **2026-06-18** — Mobile My Account: **Description** column hidden by default on small screens; **Show Descriptions** / **Hide Descriptions** toggle on member portal. **Production:** `git push` only (verify committed).
- **2026-06-13** — Cloud deploy: Render API + Netlify UI; multi-org auth; member portal with running balances and monthly PDFs; Puppeteer Chrome install on Render for PDFs; data upload via WinSCP to `/var/data`.
- **2026-06** — Multi-organization registry, per-org SQLite, separate login portals (`/member`, `/staff`, `/admin`), manual Record tab, member credential provisioning.

## 1. Background — what this project is for

The cooperative collects monthly member contributions (minimum ₦50), charges a ₦100 annual registration/admin fee, pays periodic **distributions** (profit/interest), and offers **loans** to members under specific rules. The treasurer (user: Yinka) needs to:

1. Produce **monthly PDF account statements** for every member
2. Maintain an accurate **ledger** of deposits, withdrawals, distributions, and loans
3. Eventually **reconcile Bank of America** exports against member activity
4. Keep **member banking profiles** (KYC-style data from membership applications)

Historically, everything lived in Excel (`Assurance Status` workbooks). This repo automates statement PDFs and has started a proper ledger app (PeerFinanceManager).

### Key business rules already encoded

**Statements (`lib/statement-generator.js`):**

- Positive month cell = deposit; negative = withdrawal
- Distribution column on workbook (e.g. `* Distribution - February`) is credited on statements
- Distribution row in the period table sits **after February deposit** (user-requested layout)
- Members with a withdrawal in the statement window: closing balance = `Total Deposits + withdrawals` only; registration and distribution still displayed but not double-counted
- Ejiro Awhotu is the canonical test case: April 2026 withdrawal −₦1,721.91 → balance **₦995.59**

**Ledger (`peer-finance-manager/`):**

- Membership fee: ₦100
- Loan: 2 guarantors, 6+ months membership, max = min(borrower deposits, guarantors combined), 8% / 12 months default
- Late fee: $25 after 22nd (logic in `loan-service.js`)
- Spreadsheet import dates deposits on **last day of month** (placeholder); **bank import** uses real dates from BoA CSV

**Bank CSV (`lib/bank-statement-parser.js`):**

- Uses `Narrative` column: only `Member Deposit` / `Member Withdrawal` count toward contributions
- Known mislabels in `stmt (1).csv`: Gbanju and Oluwabiyi loan payments tagged as `Member Deposit` — **workbook wins**

### Local development

**Assurance Cooperative Manager** (`PeerFinanceManager.exe` / port **3457**) is the one app:

- Members, profiles, ledger, imports, loans
- **Statements tab** — PDF generation via `peer-finance-manager/lib/statement-routes.js` → root `lib/statement-generator.js`

The old standalone server on port 3456 is legacy (`npm run statements:legacy-server`). `generator.html` redirects to 3457.

### Critical files — read these first

| Priority | File | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| 1 | `lib/statement-generator.js` | All statement logic, balance edge cases, PDF HTML |
| 2 | `peer-finance-manager/lib/import-spreadsheet.js` | How workbook maps to ledger |
| 3 | `peer-finance-manager/lib/import-bank-ledger.js` | Bank CSV + xlsx → ledger transactions |
| 4 | `peer-finance-manager/lib/parse-bank-sources.js` | Merges BoA CSV with All deposits.xlsx |
| 5 | `peer-finance-manager/lib/ledger-import-audit.js` | Pre-import proxy/type warnings on Bank Ledger Import |
| 6 | `peer-finance-manager/lib/cooperative-meeting-service.js` | Per-tenant meeting schedule, announce, reminders |
| 7 | `lib/bank-statement-parser.js` | BoA CSV + Narrative + name aliases (statements/compare) |
| 8 | `peer-finance-manager/lib/member-name-match.js` | Application ↔ ledger names; proxy Zelle beneficiary |
| 9 | `peer-finance-manager/lib/member-self-service.js` | Member portal profile, photo, emergency contact |
| 10 | `peer-finance-manager/db/schema.sql` | DB shape |

### Ports

- **3457** — **Assurance Cooperative Manager** — `npm start` or double-click **`PeerFinanceManager.exe`**
- **3456** — Legacy statement-only server (`npm run statements:legacy-server`) — deprecated

**Exe locations:** `PeerFinanceManager.exe` (project root) and `peer-finance-manager/dist/PeerFinanceManager.exe`. Rebuild with `npm run pfm:build`. Build copies `lib/statement-generator.js` and `styles.css` beside the exe for PDF generation.

### npm scripts reference

```powershell
npm start                  # Assurance Cooperative Manager (port 3457)
npm run pfm                # Same as npm start
npm run pfm:seed           # Ledger from spreadsheet
npm run pfm:profiles       # WPForms → profiles
npm run pfm:import-bank    # Bank CSV + xlsx → ledger (real dates)
npm run generate:may-2026  # Bank + workbook → May PDFs
npm run compare:bank       # Workbook vs bank CSV
npm run pfm:build          # Package PFM as .exe
npm run statements:legacy-server  # Deprecated port 3456 only
```

## 4. Outstanding tasks (prioritized)

### High — operational / product

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | **Load active loans** | Framework exists; bank activity documented. User to provide schedules. |
| 2 | **Cooperative expenses** | Table exists; no UI/import. |
| 3 | **Profile for Kehinde Agboola** | Olawale George added (WPForms row + local import). Kehinde still has no application row. |
| 4 | **PC ↔ cloud data sync** | **Bank ledger:** Admin → Import on live site (no WinSCP). **Profiles/manual DB edits:** WinSCP + Manual Deploy. |
| 5 | ~~**Wire bank import into Import tab UI**~~ | ✅ Done — Admin → Import → Bank Ledger Import (`POST /api/bank-import/run`). |
| 6 | **Persist Title Case in database (backfill)** | Script: `npm run pfm:normalize-profiles` then `:apply` locally → WinSCP upload + Manual Deploy. Display/save formatters already live (`2ce0dd7`). |
| 7 | **FlexxForms embed country default** | Address (US-Type) country/phone dropdowns show "Loading…" in embed; lazy country chunk or missing default US. Fix in FlexxForms (default field value + reliable country list in iframe). |

### High — user said they will provide info later

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| 7 | **Member photos** | Admin and member upload supported; most members still on placeholder SVG. |

### Medium — operational

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| 8 | **June 2026 statements** | Bank CSV has June deposits (partial month). Generalize `generate-may-2026-from-bank.js` → month argument. |
| 9 | **April distribution on statements** | May statements use February distribution column (workbook fallback). Confirm when amounts finalized. |
| 10 | **January 2026 verification** | Workbook has Jan 2026 column; bank CSV starts 2 Feb 2026. |
| 11 | **Regenerate April PDFs** | After distribution layout fix, April folder may have old layout if not re-run. |
| 12 | **Spreadsheet import placeholder dates** | `pfm:seed` still uses last-day-of-month; bank-imported txs have real dates. |
| 13 | **Currency display consistency** | Statements use NGN; PFM UI uses USD formatter. Cosmetic unless user wants one currency. |
| 14 | **Verify PDF statements on production** | Member monthly download after Puppeteer Chrome deploy. |

### Low — engineering hygiene

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| 15 | **Unify bank parsers** | Root `bank-statement-parser.js` vs PFM `parse-bank-sources.js` overlap. |
| 16 | **PFM bank-import tests** | `scripts/test-ledger-import-audit.js` covers proxy + contribution-type checks; expand as needed. |
| 17 | **Rebuild PFM exe** | After schema/profile/UI changes. |
| 18 | **Ejiro / withdrawal regression** | Always verify Ejiro balance when touching `statement-generator.js`. |

## 5. Known issues & gotchas

1. **Wrong May column** — Workbook has May columns for 2023–2026. Always match **year row + month header** (May 2026 = column index **46** on current sheets). Do not use `indexOf('May')` alone.

2. **Bank narrative errors** — Three April-ish mislabels documented in compare script output. Never blindly sum all `Member Deposit` rows without description checks.

3. **Proxy Zelle deposits** — `from X for Y` must credit **Y**, not X (e.g. Yinka for Ejiro/Titilope). Import auto-fixes via `member-name-match.js`; Admin → Import shows **Ledger warnings** if still wrong. After `git push`, re-import corrected `cooperative-bank-ledger-reference.xlsx`.

4. **Gbanju 4/20/2026** — ₦434.34 loan repayment mislabeled `Member Deposit` in bank file.

5. **Oluwabiyi 3/16 and 4/10** — ₦443.55 loan payments mislabeled `Member Deposit`. Mar 2026 **$100.13** was also mis-tagged `loan_repayment` in master ledger (fixed to `deposit`).

6. **Two Oluwatosin members** — `Oluwatosin Omotuyole` vs `Oluwatosin Ogunbowale`; bank alias patterns disambiguate.

7. **Sonia Udom CSV row** — First name `Sonia`, last name `Abraham Udom`; mapped to ledger `Sonia Udom`.

8. **Akili spelling** — Application `Tcha Binidi` → ledger `Akili Tcha Bindi`.

9. **`replaceExisting: true` on spreadsheet import** — Wipes ledger. Profiles survive in `member_profiles` table but re-link only if members re-imported with same names.

10. **Puppeteer** — Requires Chrome or Edge on Windows. Worker runs in separate process (`scripts/run-generation-worker.js`).

11. **Timezone date display** — `YYYY-MM-DD` strings parsed as `new Date('2026-06-08')` show one day early in US time zones. Fixed in `formatDate()` / `formatDisplayDate()` by parsing as local calendar date. Verify after any new date formatting code.

12. **User rules** — Do not git commit unless asked. Use `gh` for PRs. Real shell environment.

13. **Documentation** — `.cursor/rules/continuous-documentation.mdc` is `alwaysApply: true`. Update docs in the **same turn** as every change. Read `AGENT_HANDOVER.md` first every session. The user must never need to ask for doc updates.

## 6. Verification checklist (after changes)

```powershell
# Ledger + profiles
npm run pfm:seed
npm run pfm:profiles
npm run pfm:import-bank   # After updating bank CSV / All deposits.xlsx

# Reconciliation
npm run compare:bank
node peer-finance-manager/scripts/test-ledger-import-audit.js

# Statements
npm run generate:may-2026
# Manually spot-check: Ejiro ($991.00 contributions), Yinka ($2,430.98), proxy warnings clear on Import tab

# Apps start
npm start   # → http://localhost:3457 (Assurance Cooperative Manager)
```

## 7. User communication context

- User is building this incrementally; **loans, expenses, and unclear items** will be provided later.
- User confirmed **regular member deposits** can be tracked now with workbook + bank CSV + Narrative column.
- User cares about **statement presentation** (distribution placement was explicitly corrected).
- **Assurance Status 4 2026** is authoritative through April 2026 end.
- Transcript of full build history: `.cursor/projects/.../agent-transcripts/0476ec24-f606-4198-a323-74c9b1aec2c6/0476ec24-f606-4198-a323-74c9b1aec2c6.jsonl`

---

## 8. Suggested next session plan

1. After deploy: **Admin → Import** corrected `cooperative-bank-ledger-reference.xlsx`; confirm **Ledger warnings** panel is empty
2. Import loan records + schedules when user provides data
3. Generalize month-from-bank script for June onward
4. Add Olawale / Kehinde profiles if applications supplied
5. Optional: single “monthly close” command — bank reconcile → update workbook → generate PDFs → refresh ledger → WinSCP upload

---

## 9. UI copy conventions (user-mandated)

Documented in `.cursor/rules/ui-copy-standards.mdc`. Apply to all new or edited user-facing text.

1. **Title Case** — Headers, paragraph hints, labels, buttons, badges, and section titles use Title Case (e.g. `Cooperative Books`, `Import Profiles`, `On File`). **Do not capitalize** 2–3 letter words (`in`, `and`, `for`, `to`, `is`, etc.) unless first or last in the heading. Always capitalize **Cooperative** when referring to the member-owned organization.

2. **Slash compounds — no spaces** — When joining terms with `/`, do not space around the slash:
   - `Contributions Account/Loan Account` (not `Contributions Account / Loan Account`)
   - `Distribution/Interest`, `Zelle/Bank`, `Members/Profiles`, `22/24`
   - Same rule on PDF statement labels (e.g. `Interest/Distribution`)
